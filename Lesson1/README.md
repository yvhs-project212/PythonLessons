# Lesson 1: Welcome to Python!

## Look at the sample program

Load up the sample program using a text editor (such as VS Code).

At this point, you might not know any Python at all.  Before you run the
program, what do you think it will do?  Can you make some guesses about how
programming works, even if you don't know Python?

See if you can predict *exactly* what the program will print.

## Run the sample program

1. Use `cd` to change into the `Lesson1/` directory.
1. From a terminal window (such as a Git Bash window), run `py -3 ./lesson1.py`

How close was your guess to what the computer actually printed?

## Change the sample program

1. Assuming your name is *not* Ebenezer, how can you change the program to
greet *you* instead of Ebenezer?
1. Make the change, and run the program again.  Did it work?
1. How can you use Git to see what changes you made, compared with what's
on GitHub?
