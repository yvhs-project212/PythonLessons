# Basic Python (and Git) lessons

## Prerequisites:
* You have a computer to use for your own work
* Python is installed on your computer
  * For 2024, Python version 3.12 is required.  3.13 WILL NOT WORK!
  * When installing Python, make sure to check the box requesting Python to be added to your path!
* Git has been installed on your computer
  * Installing Git requires answering a series of complicated questions.  You may want a mentor (or student expert) to help with this.
* You can run Python and get an interactive session.
  * An interactive session prompts you with `>>>` and waits for you to type commands or expressions.  It will then evaluate what you typed, and execute any commands and print the value of any expressions.  (This is called a "read-evaluate-print loop", sometimes known as a REPL.)
  * You can exit from an interactive session on Windows by pressing `Enter` acter a line where you only typed `Ctrl-Z`.

## Use `git clone` to copy the repository to your computer

* Make sure there is a directory called `repos/` under your home directory.  (Use the `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls` commands!)
* Use `cd` to change into the `repos/` directory.
* Type `git clone https://github.com/YVHS-Project212/PythonLessons`

You should now have a directory called `PythonLessons/` under your `repos/` directory, and that `PythonLessons/` directory should contain all the lessons.  Use `cd` to change directories into `Lesson1` (or whichever lesson you want to start with) and learn some Python!
