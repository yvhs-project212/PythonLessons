# Lesson 2: Python control flow

## Look at the sample program

Load up the sample program using a text editor.  Read through the comments,
and the code.  What do you understand about the program?  What still isn't
clear?

See if you can predict *exactly* what the program will print.

## Run the sample program

1. Use `cd` to change into the `Lesson2/` directory.
1. From a terminal window (such as a Git Bash window), run `py -3 ./lesson2.py`

How close was your guess to what the computer actually printed?
